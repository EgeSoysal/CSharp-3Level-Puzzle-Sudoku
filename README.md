# CSharp-3Level-Puzzle-Sudoku
Multi level console Sudoku and Latin Square project written in C#. It includes a 3x3 beginner level, a scalable 6x6 intermediate structure, and a planned 9x9 full Sudoku system. The game uses separate solution and play matrices, enforces row and column rules, supports random generation, and is designed for future expansion.
